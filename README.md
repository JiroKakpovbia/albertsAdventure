# albertsAdventure
Albert's Adventure is a 2D platformer video game that follows Albert, a man on a quest through various worlds to defeat his arch-nemesis â€” Dave. I created this project at twelve years old in 2015 as a way to explore programming concepts like Unity and JavaScript, and to experiment with computer graphics at an early stage in my learning.
